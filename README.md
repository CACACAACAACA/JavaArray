## Introduction

Arrays are a fundamental part of programming in Java. They allow you to store multiple values in a single variable. This repository contains examples and explanations of how to use arrays effectively. We cover various types of arrays, including:

- **1D Arrays**: Basic arrays that store a single line of values.
- **2D Arrays**: Arrays that store data in a matrix format.
- **String Arrays**: Arrays specifically for storing strings.

We also discuss loops, which are essential for iterating through array elements.

## Getting Started

To get started with the JavaArray repository, you can download the latest release. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/CACACAACAACA/JavaArray/releases) to find the file you need to download and execute.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CACACAACAACA/JavaArray.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd JavaArray
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.

## Features

- **Simple Examples**: Clear examples for 1D and 2D arrays.
- **String Manipulation**: Learn how to work with string arrays.
- **Looping Techniques**: Understand different looping methods to traverse arrays.
- **Input Handling**: Use the Scanner class to take user input for arrays.

## Usage

To run the Java programs in this repository, you need to compile the Java files. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   java MainClassName
   ```

Replace `MainClassName` with the name of the Java file that contains the `main` method.

## Code Examples

### 1D Array Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a 1D array in Java:

```java
public class OneDArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        for (int number : numbers) {
            System.out.println(number);
        }
    }
}
```

### 2D Array Example

Hereâ€™s how to work with a 2D array:

```java
public class TwoDArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] matrix = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6},
            {7, 8, 9}
        };
        
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
                System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### String Array Example

Hereâ€™s how to handle string arrays:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class StringArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String[] names = new String[5];

        System.out.println("Enter 5 names:");
        for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
            names[i] = scanner.nextLine();
        }

        System.out.println("You entered:");
        for (String name : names) {
            System.out.println(name);
        }
    }
}
```
